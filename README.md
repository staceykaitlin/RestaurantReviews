# Project 5: Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I was tasked in creating an incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer and follow the instructions below:

1. In the repository start a simple HTTP server to serve your files on your local computer. You can use Python for this which is possibly already installed on your computer.
    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, this will now show you the live site.
